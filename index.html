          <p>Hello! This is my website. I wanted to make a website because it's a convenient place to show off my art.
          <br>What's my art? Simple! It's <b>Pixel Art!</b>
          <br>"Pixel Art's" existed for thousands of years, in lotsa forms. Looms, tiling, and knitted sweaters are all examples of the same kind of art. I use computer pixels!</p>
          <p>There's other stuff here too. Enjoy!</p>

                <p>Wario Land 4 is Nintendo's best Wario game. It rivals Super Mario Bros 3 in terms of consistent quality. It has jams, art, and artsy jams like this.</p.>
                <p>F-Zero's a very Tactical racing game, which makes it sooo satisfying to get good at. If only it was 3 or 4 laps per track instead of 5. So close to perfection.</p>
                <p>Spelunky is a game with good jams. Every section of the game is jammin'. You can hate the gameplay, but you can't hate the live performance.</p>
                <p>Katamari Damacy is a game you can emulate on your computer for free</p>
                <p>It's "Johann Sebastian." Legend says that a musician once challenged him to a musical duel, where one aristocrat would play their instrument, then another would play, and whoever was in the tavern at the time would watch and decide who was better. This duelist, when he heard Bach merely warming up his fingers, left.</p>

        <h2>I LIKE THESE ARTISTS YOU WILL LIKE THEM TOO. YOU WILL LIKE THEM</h2>
            - Pochowek is my favorite twitter furry artist. He is from Poland. He discusses high literature and philosophy in his subversively scrappy artwork. SCREAM IF YOU LOVE POLAND!!!!!!!!
        <br>- xxx_acidNeko_xxx is my 2nd favorite. He is on tumblr actually. He draws very colorful things in mspaint and he is cool and swaggy.
        <br>- I like OutsideWolves. The Wolves Outside. He is French. He draws non sequiters. His art reminds me of Hergé (AKA Georges Remi) (Hergé drew Tintin, if you didn't know.). Browse with mild caution.
        <br>- Yoko Shimomura is one of my favorite composers. She writes entire game soundtracks! She's worked on Street Fighter II, Super Mario RPG, and like 50 other video games. She still composes as of 2024 (this year!). She's currently working on Kingdom Hearts IV.
        <br>- Ryoji Yoshitomi. 'nuff said.
        <br>- umm uhh i like beethoven :3
        <br>- that's it!
        <h2>CLOSING THOUGHTS <a style=background-color:#8888ff; href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/undertale/sheet/76865/"><img src="images/yesss.png" alt="yes pose"></a></h2>
        <p>Sometimes in my life I feel like the smartest coolest person the world, or like I'm living in my own world that was built for me. I can become arrogant and waste your time (I am sorry if we meet and I do this to you). But I am not super smart! And this world is not for me. <br> How I feel is: remember to take a step back and think about the people outside of your own life. Always keep living!! Live with urgency and gusto and full of love for everything. Never be arrogant; there is no one to be arrogant to. Think hard about your thinking, and you will not go wrong. Go! With love!!<3  
        <br>As I'm writing this I'm 19. I still have a long time to live, yet my life is so short. "Such is the human experience..." The connections you make, the friends you find, the love you share, will outlive you. It's our legacy. Always love people.</p>
