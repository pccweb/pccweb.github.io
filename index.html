            <br>"Pixel Art" has existed for thousands of years, in lotsa forms: Looms, tiling, and knitted sweaters are all examples of the same kind of art. I use computer pixels!
          </p>

            There's other stuff here too. Enjoy!

                    I love icons and signals, a LOT.
                    I love being told what to do instantly from a bite-sized colorful morsel.
                    The driving knowledge test is full of this.<br>
                    If I'm gonna get a career in HVAC (my original career idea) I'm gonna need to be a thriving driver.

                  Wario Land 4 is Nintendo's best Wario game. It rivals Super Mario Bros 3 in terms of consistent 
                  quality. It has jams, art, and artsy jams like this.
                <hr>
                  F-Zero's a very Tactical racing game, which makes it sooo satisfying to get good at. If only it was 
                  3 or 4 laps per track instead of 5. So close to perfection.
                <hr>
                  Spelunky is a game with good jams. Every section of the game is jammin'. You can hate the gameplay,
                  but you can't hate the live performance.
                <hr>
                  Katamari Damacy is a game you can emulate on your computer for free
                <hr>
                  It's "Johann Sebastian." Legend says that a wealthy musician once challenged him to a musical duel,
                  where all the drinkers and tavern-goers would judge who was better. 
                  This duelist, when he heard Bach merely warming up his fingers, left.

                  Solatorobo is a robot-riding sumo-fighting role-playing story-game with cat-men and dog-women.
                  It's not particularly hard or fun, but it's so bursting-at-the-seams-full of love that I can't 
                  help but care about it.
                <br>...<br>
                  You can only play it on the DS, so find your favorite pirate website and download this game
                  to your favorite flashcart/emulator.
                <br>...<br>
                  Two Solatorobo pieces are here. One plays when you fly through the sky, and the other plays
                  when you visit the town "Shetland." Every song in Solatorobo is worthy of being on this
                  website, but those are my favorites so far.

              - <strong>Pochowek</strong> is my favorite twitter furry artist. He is from Poland. He discusses high literature and philosophy in his subversively scrappy artwork. SCREAM IF YOU LOVE POLAND!!!!!!!!
          <br>- <strong>xxx_acidNeko_xxx</strong> is my 2nd favorite. He is on tumblr actually. He draws very colorful things in mspaint and he is cool and swaggy.
          <br>- I like <strong>OutsideWolves.</strong> The Wolves Outside. He is French. He draws non sequiters. His art reminds me of Hergé (AKA Georges Remi) (Hergé drew Tintin, if you didn't know.). Browse with mild caution.
          <br>- <strong>Yoko Shimomura</strong> is one of my favorite composers. She writes entire game soundtracks! She's worked on Street Fighter II, Super Mario RPG, and like 50 other video games. She still composes as of 2024 (this year!). She's currently working on Kingdom Hearts IV.
          <br>- <strong>Ryoji Yoshitomi.</strong> 'nuff said.
          <br>- umm uhh i like <strong>beethoven </strong>
          <br>- that's <strong>it!</strong>
          <br>- No it isn't. <strong>Laura Shigihara</strong> is a freelance composer who writes songs and videogame soundtracks. She has her own style that is very apparent in every one of her works. ON HER SOUNDTRACK WORK: some may think that she doesn't invoke the feeling of the "environment," that her personal touches are too distracting. To that I say phooey. Anyone can write a hundred thousand identical pirate songs, but only Ms. Shigihara can write a Shigi-Pirate song. A good song is infinitely more valuable that a thematic song, and Shigihara can mix both goodness and themes into a single, seamless musical cocktail. I'm basically just ranting to a specific person on the internet I once saw at this point. If you know who you are and you see this, then just know you got owned. Completely and entirely pwned. Bitch

              <pre>Heaven and Earth are everlasting
  The reason Heaven and Earth can last forever
    Is that they do not exist for themselves
      Thus they can last forever
        Therefore the sages:
          Place themselves last but end up in front
            Are outside of themselves and yet survive
              Is it not due to their selflessness?
                That is how they can achieve their own goals</pre>

            Sometimes in my life I feel like the smartest coolest person the world, or like I'm living in my own world that was built for me. I can become arrogant and waste your time (I am sorry if we meet and I do this to you). But I am not super smart! And this world is not for me. <br> How I feel is: remember to take a step back and think about the people outside of your own life. Always keep living!! Live with urgency and gusto and full of love for everything. Never be arrogant; there is no one to be arrogant to. Think hard about your thinking, and you will not go wrong. Go! With love!!<3  
            <br>As I'm writing this I'm 19. I still have a long time to live, yet my life is so short. "Such is the human experience..." The connections you make, the friends you find, the love you share, will outlive you. It's our legacy. Always love people.
            <br>
            <br>Always.
