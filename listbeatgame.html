    In spite of that, some artists are insane and decide to use the 
    artistic medium for good.
    
    Here are some games worth playing and why:
    CAVE STORY:
       ~10 hours.
       You can find this game for free at https://cavestory.org.
       It's a platforming-shooting-exploring game.
       It's probably the game worth playing the least. I only put it
       here because of the amount of love that was put into this game.
       It was made by one man, I forget his name. He was a
       business man who needed to support his family, I think.
       Also, unlike most games, this game gets more fun the longer
       you play it.
    UNDERTALE
      6 - 18 hours.
      It's $10 on https://undertale.com.
      It's a top-down exploration puzzle fighting role-playing game.
      It's a modern-ish game which I like. It talks about the value of
      a life and how we distance ourselves from harming "fictional
      characters." It can be played multiple times.
    SOLATOROBO
      20-30 hours.
      It's impossible to find.
      Don't play this game. It isn't worth it. There is little story,
      little strategy. The only thing that saves this game from hell is
      the worldbuilding and art. GOOD LORD there is a lot of
      worldbuilding and art. If every videogame had as much attention
      paid to the aesthetics I might put them all on this list.
      If you like paintings and anthropomorphic animals, watch a play-
      through of this game.
    SPELUNKY HD
      40+ hours.
      It's $15 on https://store.steampowered.com.
      This game is like when in Rocky, you know the movie? His master
      beats the shit out of him and is like, "do better!" and then
      Rocky gets so good that he beats his master and then the grand
      champion and it's cathartic as hell. That happens in this game.
      To summarize, it's like Super Mario Bros, except the levels
      change every time you die.
      Also, there are a lot of secrets to find.
    WE <3 KATAMARI
      ??? hours.
      Remake: $50
      Original: $25
      This game is better than opiates. The creator said this game is
      supposed to spread the message of love and togetherness, but I
      think it spreads me over the bed and fucks me raw (no safeword)
    RHYTHM HEAVEN
      10 hours.
      $25 - $60. No longer in production. 
      This remains the only rhythm game I enjoy. The fun comes from 
      seeing the amount of love they put into the music and 
      graphics... and the learning you accomplish as you play this 
      tough-as-nails video game.
      If you have a good sense of Rhythm, you'll enjoy this game a
      lot. If you have a bad sense of Rhythm, you'll get your ass
      beat until you can hold a meter. And you'll feel awesome
      the whole time.
      Also, this game is cute.
    METAL GEAR SOLID 2: SONS OF LIBERTY
      20 hours.
      Remake: $20-40
      Original: $25
      You might wonder why I put the sequel here, and not the original.
      Fuck the original! This one has way more to say philosophically.
      This game is a crazy stealth movie where you control the main
      character. Mission impossible wishes it could hold a candle to 
      this. James Bond is sweating nervously, watching from the corner 
      of his eye. I wish I could write a story like this.
      The level of detail in this game is satanic. You can burst steam 
      pipes with your gun. It's not even necessary for anything, but 
      you can do that. It distracts the guards while you sneak around,
      too. Like, what the hell. They thought of everything. Fuck.
    PUNCH-OUT!!
      10 hours of fun until the game gets too hard.
      It's $0 if you pirate it.
      Why am I putting this old-ass shitty 8-bit game on here? 'Cause
      of what it stands for. Punch-Out!! looks like a fighting game at
      first glance. But no matter how hard you try, you can't beat
      them. Why? Because you haven't found their WEAKNESSES. Like in
      real life, every fighter has a weakness you MUST exploit to win.
      You play as "little Mac." You aren't strong, and you aren't fast.
      But maybe you're smart. And if you're smart... that's all you 
      need to win.
      
    Good luck to you, future person, if you try to play these games. We can only hope the library of historical video
    games is more open and free in the future.
