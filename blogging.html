                    Very exciting things are goin on in my life. One of those things is that my uncle came home to live with us, and he's remodeling one of our rooms as I type this... another thing is that I could be getting a job soon. I have to pass the employer's trials first... It'll be worth it, though! I really do hope they consider me.

    <td>I was biking with my dad to visit the great river in our city. It's a very long, very thin, national park. It's beautiful. On the way there, I accidentally braked (broke?) too hard and scraped my hands, knee, and hip. It was the first time I had been scraped in years, and I was bleeding. Not too much, just a little. It felt scary for a moment. Then I realized, I could change how I felt about it. I decided that the pain felt good, and that I needed the pain, after going to long without getting hurt. And you know what? It didn't hurt less, but it was more... bearable.<br>08/14/24
