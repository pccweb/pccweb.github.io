                    No one's callin back or hiring me anywhere. To be fair, I don't care that much, and I haven't been looking...<br>
                    Instead of job searching, I learn how to code in C. I'm also practicing drawing. I Think that makes up for not getting a job. Jeez, it's been almost a couple years since I got out of school, though...<br>
                    is anyone out there into unintelligent losers ... ?..

                    I'm currently dog-sitting. I realized that my stride is housecleaning, and my speed is having way 
                    too much time on my hands. I wonder more about my future occupation with every day.
                    Here's a good thing to know: wondering can only widen your job prospects, but applying and 
                    practicing jobs will helpfully narrow them down!
                    There are a lot of things in my life I wish I knew sooner. I am thinking of making a cartoon series
                    that goes in-depth on Things People Don't Explain for Some Reason.

                    Very exciting things are goin on in my life. One of those things is that my uncle came home to live with us, and he's remodeling one of our rooms as I type this... another thing is that I could be getting a job soon. I have to pass the employer's trials first... It'll be worth it, though! I really do hope they consider me.

    <td>I was biking with my dad to visit the great river in our city. It's a very long, very thin, national park. It's beautiful. On the way there, I accidentally braked (broke?) too hard and scraped my hands, knee, and hip. It was the first time I had been scraped in years, and I was bleeding. Not too much, just a little. It felt scary for a moment. Then I realized, I could change how I felt about it. I decided that the pain felt good, and that I needed the pain, after going to long without getting hurt. And you know what? It didn't hurt less, but it was more... bearable.<br>08/14/24
